    "The `OTO` and `UTO` operators use addition and multiplication mod 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transposition\n",
    "Transposition corresponds to addition. $T_5(9) = (9 + 5) \\textrm{ mod } 12 = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication\n",
    "There are four multipliers that work for multiplication: 1, 5, 7, and 11. The other multipliers aren't one-to-one operations (they can't produce all twelve pitch-classes), which makes them unsuitable for most uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication by 1 is an *identity* operation - it makes no change. $M_1(9) = (9 \\cdot 1) \\textrm{ mod } 12 = 9$.\n",

    "Multiplication by 11 is equivalent to inversion. $M_{11}(9) = I(9) = (9 \\cdot 11) \\textrm{ mod } 12 = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication by 5 sometimes maps into the same set-class, and sometimes into a different set-class. The same is true of multiplication by 7. It turns out that multiplication by 7 is the same as multiplication by 5, then multiplication by 11. For this reason, $M_{11}$ (inversion) is often denoted as $I$, $M_5$ is often denoted simply as $M$, and $M_7$ is often denoted as $MI$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why multiply first, then transpose?\n",
    "You don't have to multiply first - you can perform the multiplication second. However, this will always be the same as some other operation that performed the multiplication first, then transposition second. The index of transposition may be different, but the result will be the same. For simplicity, the operators in `pctheory` multiply first."
